# Quick Search

Press `Alt` + any letter or number to open a search
popup. The popup appears near the active pane's border
with a teal input box on a light gray background.

## How It Works

- The initial character is placed in the search box and
  the cursor jumps to the first matching entry
  (case-insensitive prefix match)
- Continue typing to narrow the search -- each character
  is accepted only if it extends a valid prefix match
- Press `Backspace` to remove the last character
- Press `Escape` to close and keep cursor on the match
- Press `Enter` to close and act on the matched entry
  (enter directory or open file)
- Any navigation key (`Up`, `Down`, `Tab`, `PgUp`,
  `PgDn`) also closes the popup
